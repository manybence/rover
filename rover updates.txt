TODO:
1. Robustness of start up and comm prot
2. does baud rate matter?
3. flow control / no-flow control, etc
4. Find things that are not working
Windows - Linux problems
Dedicated command compiler?
Add horizontal limits
Make robust comm protocol - timeout happens while typing
Timer better resolution (maybe hw processor reading directly)
Left switch activated - only write once
check implemented library functions - maybe they would be useful
comm prot - log file


- Status display correctly
- Comments - default value = empty

TODO priorities
